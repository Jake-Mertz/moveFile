# moveFile
A series of solutions for the transfer of files.

solution1 is a partial solution for exemplification of functionality sans the choice of function execution date/time.

solution2 is a complete client-side solution.

solution3 (inside the server-side folder) is a complete solution which moves files by uploading them to MongoDB, then downloading them from MongoDB to a different directory than where they were saved originally. I'm not sure whether this is a server-side solution or not.
