# moveFile
A series of solutions for the transfer of files.

solution1 is a partial solution for exemplification of functionality sans the choice of a particular time of function execution.
solution2 is a complete client-side solution.
solution3 (inside the server-side folder) is a complete solution which utilizes MongoDB for the movement of files. I'm still not sure whether this is technically a server-side solution or not.
